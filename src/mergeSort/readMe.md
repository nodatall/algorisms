# Merge Sort Algorithm

### Given an array of integers, sort it using merge sort algorithm.

##### Solution in English

Compare numbers two a time from left to right, sorting by largeness. Initialize counter at 1. Put back into array in new order. Do for each pair. If number is stranded, put back. Double value of counter, then compare groups of counter and sort.

SortSet. Takes two ordered lists. Looks at the first two elements, puts the smaller one in result. Continue until both lists are empty.

##### Time complexity
O(n log n)
